# Magento 2 Helm Chart (Archived)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project began as an open-source initiative to simplify Magento 2 deployments using Helm. While it served as a foundational idea, it has since evolved into a more robust and feature-rich solution.

## Introducing Magento 2 Helm
We are excited to present [Magento 2 Helm](https://github.com/nholuongut/magento2-helm.git), a production-grade Helm chart designed specifically for Magento 2. Magento 2 Helm offers a comprehensive set of features to streamline your Magento infrastructure:​

- Autoscaling: Automatically adjusts resources based on traffic demand.
- Environment Consistency: Ensures uniformity across development, staging, and production environments.
- Automation: Reduces manual intervention with automated workflows for deployments and maintenance.
- Maintenance: Simplifies long-term management with standardized configurations.
- Cloud Native: Built to leverage modern cloud architecture principles.
- Infrastructure-Agnostic: Deploy across various cloud platforms without vendor lock-in.
- Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks: Smooth updates with the ability to revert if issues are detected.
- Self-Healing: Ensures high availability with automatic service recovery.​

Is designed to save engineering time and provide a reliable, scalable infrastructure for Magento 2.​
